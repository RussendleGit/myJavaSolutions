Create a program that will generate and print out 10 random phone numbers, of the format XXX-XXX-XXXX.

    Include the dashes in the output.
    Do not let the first three digits (the area code) contain an 8 or a 9. The Area Code should not start with a 0
    Make sure the second set of three digits is less than 655 and should not start with a 0.
    No need to create a separate class.
